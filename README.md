# DOTAset

This is the last project I made for the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.

This project was really fun to do since I analyzed my gaming data. I started playing Dota 2 a long time ago, but I never had looked into my statistics. I've made some discoveries about my gaming style with this project.

Feel free to give feedback! =D
